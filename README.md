Please note, I'm not affiliated with Here To Record in any way (except that I love their software).

Also, I'm not to be held liable if these break! If you find an issue that **doesn't appear** in the [official builds](https://github.com/iamjohnbarker/h2r-graphics-releases/releases), please open an issue [here](https://github.com/cjdenio/h2r-graphics-linux/issues/new).
